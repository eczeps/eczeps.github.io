Hi!  I'm Ellie.  I'm a current sophomore studying Computer Science at Wellesley College.  Feel free to explore some of the projects I've been working on!

## Projects

### <span style="color:green">[Wikipedia Roamer](https://eczeps.github.io/WikipediaRoamer/)</span>
<span style="color:green">This is a collaborative project that imitates playing the Wikipedia Game, in which players choose a starting and an ending Wikipedia page and race to see who can traverse through Wikipedia's hyperlinks to get from one page to the other.</span>

### [Sound Animation](https://eczeps.github.io/sound_animation/)
This is a I made a while back that creates a graphic that responds to sound.
