Hi!  I'm Ellie.  I'm a current sophomore studying Computer Science at Wellesley College.  Feel free to explore some of the projects I've been working on!

## Projects

## Wikipedia Roamer
This was a [collaborative project](https://eczeps.github.io/WikipediaRoamer/) that imitates playing the Wikipedia Game, in which players choose a starting and an ending Wikipedia page and race to see who can traverse through Wikipedia's hyperlinks to get from one page to the other.

## Sound Animation
This is a [fun animation](https://eczeps.github.io/sound_animation/) I made a while back that creates a graphic that responds to sound.
