          <p>
            Ever played the Wikipedia Game?  Never heard of it?  Here’s a quick refresher:  To play the Wikipedia Game, two or more players choose two Wikipedia pages: a start page and an end page.  They then open the start page, and it’s a race for them to follow the hyperlinks through the Wikipedia pages to get from the start page to the end page.  Here’s an example we used, for entirely unclear reasons, when testing our program: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkinz">Webkinz</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy">The Constitution of Italy</a>. [answer as of Dec 2017: Webkinz, Stuffed Toy, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln, Habeas Corpus, Constitution of Italy]</p>

            <p>I and two others wrote a program that would “play” this game.
              The searching algorithm we created constructs two trees:
              one of the pages that are linked to from the start page, and one of the
              pages that link to the end page.  The program then searches for matches
              between the leaves on each tree, and if it finds none, constructs one more
              level of each tree.</p>

            <p>In doing this project, I had my first foray into the world of writing
            and implementing searching algorithms and Java GUI’s.</p>

            <p>The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Allison-Turner/WikipediaRoamer">here</a>.
