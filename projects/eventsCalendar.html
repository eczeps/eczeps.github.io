          <p>
            During my sophomore year of college, I noticed a pattern of students, including myself, complaining that there wasn't enough to do around campus.  I set out to make an impact on this problem.</p>
            
            <p>A friend and I started by inviting some people we knew over for a board game night, and asking everyone who came to bring someone we didn't know.  Those game nights were a ton of fun, but its members were a small portion of the students at the school, and I had a hunch that the complaints I had been hearing were not limited in scope to just the people I knew.  I sensed that there might be a broader user base -- and a better way to reach it.  I started thinking about what it might look like to make a product aimed at improving events on campus for everyone.</p>
            
            <p>I started with a theory. Maybe it wasn't that there weren't enough happening on campus, but that people simply did not know about what was going on because there was no centralized platform to find campus-wide events. I found support for my theory through various surveys and meetings, so I set out to create the Events Calendar.</p>
            
            <p>I spent all of summer 2018 working on this project.  I started with designing the website and writing all the copy for it, and then asked a group of 30 volunteers to test it and give feedback.  Based on their feedback, I redesigned part of the site and wrote some Google Script code so that students submitting an event through a Google Form would automatically add the event to the calendar.</p>
            
            <p>In doing this project, I learned to take the initiative and contact everyone I thought might be interested or want to help with it, to do both frontend and backend development for the site, and to market the site so that it actually gets used.  It was a lot of fun!</p>

        var navbar = document.getElementById("navbar");
        var sticky = navbar.offsetTop;

        function myFunction() {
          if (window.pageYOffset >= sticky) {
            navbar.classList.add("sticky");
            navbar.classList.remove("notSticky");
          } else {
            navbar.classList.add("notSticky");
